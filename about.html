                            Hi there! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Sydney Imbilu, a dedicated civil
                            engineer and aspiring software developer with a
                            passion for technology and innovation. I hold a BSc.
                            in Civil Engineering from the Technical University
                            of Mombasa and am a registered graduate engineer
                            with the Engineers Board of Kenya (EBK). Currently,
                            I'm diving deep into the world of software
                            development, working on projects involving React,
                            Next.js, and Sequelize. I have a keen interest in
                            machine learning, data science, and tech-driven
                            solutions for engineering challenges. In addition to
                            coding, I've been involved in various tech programs
                            like KIEP-SKIES, where I honed my skills in software
                            engineering and cybersecurity. Iâ€™m always eager to
                            learn, collaborate, and contribute to innovative
                            tech solutions.
